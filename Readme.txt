Project Title: Restaurant Rating Prediction – Task 1
Role: Machine Learning Intern at Cognifyz Technologies

Description:
This project aims to build a regression model that predicts restaurant ratings based on available features in a dataset. The task was completed as part of the Machine Learning Internship (Task 1) at Cognifyz Technologies.

Dataset:
The dataset (restaurant_data.csv) includes restaurant-related features such as location, cuisines, cost, and customer feedback metrics. The target variable is "aggregate_rating".

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Steps Performed:
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
2. Handled missing values using forward fill.
3. Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Trained a Linear Regression model.
6. Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
7. Visualized feature importance using a bar plot.

Output:
- MSE and R² printed in the terminal.
- Feature importance chart displayed using Matplotlib.

How to Run:
1. Make sure the dataset is saved as "restaurant_data.csv" in the same directory.
2. Run the script using:
   python task1_restaurant_rating_prediction.py
